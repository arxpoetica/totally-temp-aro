This container allows bringing up a 1+ node Ignite server cluster.

See the Makefile for commands which will build/install/run this docker container.


TO DO

Review the "Production Readiness" portion of https://apacheignite.readme.io/docs/faq and take appropriate actions.

Review the resource utilization in the Vagrant setup relative to node counts. Configure LRU config and such for dev, different for prod.

Provide make commands to instantiate/tear down a simple cluster in vagrant

Attach to an ignite container and run $IGNITE_HOME/bin/ignitevisorcmd.sh to examine grid contents and other managment/monitoring.

Consider a shell process/make which performs 'docker log -f' aggregation across the cluster to one common log tail. Alternatively, use logback to write logs to TCP aggregation point (Splunk?)

Map host ports on VirtualBox if we want to share node with IDE testing.

Use Ignite Lifecycle Events and custom Ignite LifecycleBean to notify cluster of startup/spindown of nodes, if Ignite not doing this already

Install necessary jars in ignite node container when possible, otherwise they load remotely.
